APCS class project 2\
description of our intended project\
We intend to make a game called \'93minesweeper\'94 which is\
basically the same as the game in the windows system. However,\
since our knowledge for now is still limited, we would try to create\
one based on the knowledge we have learned the semester. We\
will use two dimensional arrays to frame a game board in which \
the mines could be set. Thereby by selecting different positions in \
the mine one could seek whether there is a bomb or it is a safe spot.}
